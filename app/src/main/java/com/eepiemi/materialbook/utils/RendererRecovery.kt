 * WebView draws pages in a separate renderer process. Android can kill it to reclaim memory
 * (mostly while the app is in the background, with a video in PiP or on the lock screen, say),
 * or it can crash. By default WebView then takes the whole app down with it. This client
 * reports it instead, through [onGone] (on the main thread), and the screen replaces the
 * WebView: the one passed to [onGone] can't be used again, so only read its URL and destroy
 * it once it's out of the layout. Several WebViews can share one renderer (the main view and
 * the Messages layer), and each one that loses it gets its own call.
